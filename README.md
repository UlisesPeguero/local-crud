Local CRUD examples

[What is CRUD?](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/crud/)

Simply put CRUD is create, read, update and delete. At this moment all the examples will work from localStorage, this is due that we have not reached back-end development at the moment, localStorage is not optimal neither recommended, it only works for learning purposes.
This is just examples of using JavaScript to manipulate DOM, I will try to keep the examples as simple as possible. All styling will be simple and base on bootstraps.
Any external file will be from the ones provided by [Bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I will try to have three different versions as we move along with the course.

- **Simple**
  * List of messages, we only keep track of one field(message).
  * Uses an inline form.
  * Display messages saved in a HTML element <table>.
  * The messages remain in your broswer storage in between sessions until you reset the data.
  * There is one extra style here to make the grid rows show alternate colors.
